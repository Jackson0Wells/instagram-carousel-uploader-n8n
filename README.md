# üì∏ Google Sheets to Instagram Carousel Post Automation via Locally Hosted n8n

## Overview

This n8n workflow reads product data from a **Google Sheet**, generates a professional **Instagram carousel post caption using AI**, uploads up to 4 images, and publishes the post via the **Facebook Graph API** to your linked **Instagram Business Account**.

It also marks the post as `"uploaded"` in the sheet to avoid duplicates.

---

## üîÅ Trigger

- **Schedule Trigger**: Runs every 2 hours by default (can be changed to fit your posting frequency).

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Flow

### 1. Google Sheets ‚Äì "Is Uploaded?" Filter

- Connects to your product sheet.
- Filters rows where the `uploaded?` column is set to `"no"`.
- Returns **only 1 row** at a time to prevent batch duplicates.

### 2. Gemini AI Agent

- Uses Google‚Äôs **Gemini 1.5 Flash** (free) to generate professional captions.
- Captions include:
  - Emojis
  - Hashtags
  - Pricing callout
  - Soft CTA prompting users to "Check our bio for the link" (no direct URLs in post)

### 3. Edit Fields

- Prepares and formats:
  - Product title, description, and price
  - Image URLs from `mainimage`, `carousel1`, `carousel2`, `carousel3`
  - Gemini-generated caption
  - Instagram Page ID

### 4. Image Uploads (Flexible)

- Supports **1 to 4 image URLs** from the Google Sheet.
- Each upload is handled by a **separate Facebook Graph API node**.
- Upload is **conditionally skipped** if the image URL is empty.
- This makes the workflow dynamic ‚Äî it will still post even if only 1 or 2 images are available.
- Uploaded image container IDs are collected for use in the next step.

### 5. Merge + Prepare Carousel Media IDs

- Merges successful image uploads into one dataset.
- Outputs image media IDs in a `children` field like:

```json
{
  "children": "17932447635024904,17872489326361281"
}
```

### 6. Create Carousel Container

- Sends the `children` media IDs + caption to the Graph API.
- This creates the Instagram Carousel Container tied to your business account.

### 7. Post to Instagram

- Final API call publishes the carousel post to your Instagram feed.

### 8. Google Sheets ‚Äì Mark as Uploaded

- Updates the `uploaded?` column of the posted row to `"yes"` to prevent reposting.
